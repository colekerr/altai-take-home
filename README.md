This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using the Typescript template via 
```
npx create-react-app altai-take-home --template typescript
```

## REQUIREMENTS

create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory and copy paste the Atlas API Key into it before running the dev server as so:

```
REACT_APP_ATLAS_API_KEY="{api_key}"
```

Then, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
